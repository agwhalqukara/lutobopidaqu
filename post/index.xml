Since historians have an example of ancient writers not acknowledging monuments that are definitely there, that can add another check in the "maybe" category.
It's also worth considering that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were sometimes referred to by a different name: the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis.</description></item><item><title>Kate Middleton Seems to Repurpose Queen Elizabeth's Brooch as Earrings</title><link>/kate-middleton-seems-to-repurpose-queen-elizabeth-s-brooch-as-earrings.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/kate-middleton-seems-to-repurpose-queen-elizabeth-s-brooch-as-earrings.html</guid><description>Princess Kate Middleton honored the late Queen Elizabeth II when she stepped out at the National Service of Remembrance procession at The Cenotaph.
