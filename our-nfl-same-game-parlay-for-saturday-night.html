The Dallas defense has been a force this season, averaging just 185 passing yards from opposing QBs per game. Most of that has come against QBs of the....lesser variety...but have still managed to keep high-volume passers like Matt Stafford and Justin Herbert well under this mark, and they were in pass-heavy game scripts. Plus, the way to beat the Cowboys isn't through the air - more on that later.</p><p>Since the Lions' bye, Goff has gone under this mark in four of seven games and to no surprise, those unders feature the games where Goff turned the ball over numerous times. Well, the Cowboys have a top-eight interception rate against opposing quarterbacks coupled with a top-six pressure rate. That bodes well for quick passes and incompletions from Goff. DimersBOT projects 255 yards on average for Goff in this game and highly favors the under on his passing attempts as well.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Best NFL Prop Picks</a></strong></p><p><strong>LEG 2: David Montgomery (DET) Over 53.5 Rushing Yards (-115)</strong></p><p>Now, as we said, the solution to beating the Cowboys isn't through the air but rather via the ground game. The Lions would be wise to try and mimic the Bills' formula, in which they took the Cowboys wire-to-wire and gashed them for over 250 total rushing yards. You saw the Dolphins try and beat them via the pass and almost suffer for it.</p><p>David Montgomery has been a pleasant surprise this year and is on pace for his first 1,000-yard season since 2020. He's failed to reach this mark just once all season long and that was in an injury-shortened game way back in Week 5. Since his return, he's been a lock for 12+ carries and 55+ yards and has done so against much better-equipped rushing defenses. Monty gets a 64.4% probability to clear this mark and DimersBOT is projecting him for over 14 attempts and 71 rushing yards in this one.</p><p><strong>LEG 3: CeeDee Lamb (DAL) Under 99.5 Receiving Yards (-115)</strong></p><p>The Lions have allowed four 100-yard receivers this season: Justin Jefferson, Chris Olave, Keenan Allen and Adam Thielen. Will CeeDee Lamb be the fifth? hopefully not, because we are in fact fading the receiver with the second-most yards this season. He's having a career year but DimersBOT thinks this line is just too high, projecting him for an 85-yard performance. For all his dominance, CeeDee has only cleared this mark in two of his past six games, needing 12 catches to do so against the Seahawks who are not a good passing defense. With a consistently strong rushing defense, the Lions will turn their focus to limiting CeeDee Lamb as the Cowboys look to expose them via the pass. While this could lead to higher volume for CeeDee, we'll trust the BOT's projection here.</p><p><strong>LEG 4: Jahmyr Gibbs (DET) Anytime Touchdown (+105)</strong></p><p>We're closing out with a TD prop like always and it's on Lions rookie RB Jahmy Gibbs to punch his way into the endzone. Gibbs is nearly tied with David Montgomery for the highest scoring probability on the Lions. Gibbs has scored in seven of his last nine games with 10 total touchdowns. With a floor of around 15 touches, his volume is stable and has shown his quickness at getting around the edge, which is exactly how the Bills beat Dallas when they ran them into the ground. Gibbs has a 46.2% probability to score from DimersBOT.</p><p><strong><a href=#>🏈 </a><a href=#>Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys Predictions</a><br>📈&nbsp;<a href=#>Betting preview: Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys</a><br></strong></p><h2>NFL +1100 Same Game Parlay Saturday, December 30, 2023</h2><h3><strong>1️⃣ Jared Goff (DET) Under 263.5 Passing Yards</strong><br><strong>2️⃣ David Montgomery (DET) Over 53.5 Rushing Yards</strong><br><strong>3️⃣ CeeDee Lamb (DAL) Under 99.5 Receiving Yards<br>4️⃣ Jahmyr Gibbs (DET) Anytime Touchdown<br></strong></h3><p>The best odds for this SGP are over at DraftKings Sportsbook and are subject to change.</p><p>Don't miss Dimers' favorite <strong><a href=#>Sports Betting Sites!</a></strong></p><p>Please remember to enjoy gambling responsibly.
