Born on June 3, 1931, Raúl is one of the most crucial figures in Cuban history; his controversial and brave decisions are still influencing the nation's politics.</p><p>As a former president of Cuba, he helped to lead an extreme transformation – from communism to a more open society towards cooperation with other countries. His net worth is estimated at $100 million yet his real legacy is in his impact on Cuban citizens and their culture.</p><p>You won’t want to miss this fascinating article about Raúl Castro’s life as seen through the lens of one of today’s most glamorous magazines. From his childhood dreams to becoming one of the world's most influential politicians, discover how Raúl Castro shaped Cuba's destiny!</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luxlux.net/lux/wp-content/uploads/raul-castro-2-scaled.jpeg alt="Raúl Castro photo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 id=where-is-raul-castro-from-and-where-was-raul-castro-born><span id=Where_Is_Raul_Castro_From_and_Where_Was_Raul_Castro_Born>Where Is Raúl Castro From and Where Was Raúl Castro Born</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro was born in Birán, Holguin Province, Cuba on June 3, 1931. Born into a revolutionary family as the brother of Fidel Castro and son of Angel Casto Ruz and Lina Ruz Gonzalez, Raúl's destiny was determined from the start to become one of the most influential political figures in Cuba.</p><p>During his lifetime he has seen immense social change within his own country, becoming President of Cuba in 2008 -- a position he held until 2018. Nearing 92 years old and with a political career spanning 6 decades, Raúl Castro stands out amongst South American politicians not only for being one of the longest serving Heads of State but also for having stood firm through various US administrations intent on changing Cuban policies.</p><p>His charisma comes from the natural ability to lead without offending anyone and possessing an enlightened vision that brought about sweeping social reforms making him a beloved leader amongst his constituency. In 2023 we can still marvel at an esteemed elder statesman who is steeped in Cuban culture yet open-minded to all possibilities for his people’s future.</p><h2 id=how-old-is-raul-castro-raul-castro-age-and-birthday-info><span id=How_Old_is_Raul_Castro_Raul_Castro_Age_and_Birthday_Info>How Old is Raúl Castro? Raúl Castro Age and Birthday Info</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro is 91 years old. This summer, the Cuban politician will turn 92 - a stunning accomplishment for one of the Caribbean's most influential figures.</p><p>On June 3, 1931, he was born in Birán, Holguin Province, Cuba and has since gone on to enjoy a career spanning more than six decades! A maverick leader from an early age, Raúl served as his country’s minister of defense and assumed presidential duties alongside his brother Fidel for several years before eventually claiming full responsibility himself.</p><p>He stepped down from office in 2018 but remains involved in Cuban politics today - a reminder that he is still an active force in the region. His hard work throughout the decades and dedication to serving his people are admired far beyond Cuba's borders - not just by citizens of other countries with whom he shares common values and interests, but also within his own nation where he continues to be revered by many who recognize him as one of their greatest leaders ever.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luxlux.net/lux/wp-content/uploads/raul-castro-3-scaled.jpeg alt="Raúl Castro photo 2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 id=what-is-raul-castros-zodiac-sign><span id=What_is_Raul_Castros_Zodiac_Sign>What is Raúl Castro’s Zodiac Sign</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro is a Gemini, born on June 3, 1931. Geminis are curious and versatile - great qualities for a politician!</p><p>They are eager learners, adaptable and swift to pick up new knowledge and understand complex situations. With their natural charisma, they can hold the attention of any audience and impress many people with their intellectual gifts.</p><p>Although often quite fickle, once Raúl has made his mind up about something he will stick to it so that in negotiations he is always one step ahead. His familiarity with both sides makes him an amazing mediator - something which may come in handy for when difficult decisions need to be taken.</p><p>His endless curiosity means that he’s constantly searching for more information before committing himself to anything, so he can make the best decision possible no matter how intricate the situation may seem. At 92 years of age but still at the top of his political game after over 6 decades as leader of Cuba’s Communist party – it seems like this Gemini has already proved his beliefs right!</p><h2 id=raul-castro-net-worth-and-earnings><span id=Raul_Castro_Net_Worth_and_Earnings>Raúl Castro Net Worth and Earnings</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro's Net Worth is estimated to be around $100 Million. In Cuba, Raúl Castro is considered a revolutionary hero, and in recognition of his political career, the 91-year-old former President of the Councils of State and Ministers has built up quite a fortune over the years.</p><p>Even at his advanced age, he remains one of the wealthiest people in Cuba. Castro started his journey as a young rebel leader who joined Fidel's 26th of July Movement during an attack on Santiago de Cuba’s Moncada Barracks that sparked off the Cuban Revolution.</p><p>He was later appointed Commander-in-Chief of Cuban Armed Forces in 1959 and served as its first Minister of Defense until 2008 when Fidel handed him presidency before eventually resigning in 2018 due to health reasons. Though it may not compare to luxury lifestyles seen elsewhere in the world, Raul Castro's net worth allows him to enjoy a comfortable retirement with all expenses taken care off — something many Cubans can only dream about living their lives under US sanctions since 1962.</p><p>In this light, it can be said that Raul's wealth has proved beneficial for himself and for many others too.</p><h2 id=raul-castro-nationality-and-ethnicity><span id=Raul_Castro_Nationality_and_Ethnicity>Raúl Castro Nationality and Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro is a Cuban politician. His Cuban nationality and ethnicity have been paramount factors in his professional political career, as well as playing a huge role in the country's history.</p><p>As part of Spain's larger cultural context, with racial and ethnic ancestors from Asturian, Canary Islander, and Galician backgrounds, Raúl Castro has always embodied both Cuba's majority culture while also representing its minority heritage. His diverse roots make him both an archetypical Cuban citizen while also offering up nuances to the national dialect rooted in Spain's historical past.</p><p>From embracing traditional songs to proudly wearing clothing that symbolizes his background—Raúl Castro has become synonymous with true Cuban identity.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luxlux.net/lux/wp-content/uploads/raul-castro-4-scaled.jpeg alt="Raúl Castro photo 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 id=raul-castro-body-measurements><span id=Raul_Castro_Body_Measurements>Raúl Castro Body Measurements</span></h2><table class=tdata><tr><td>Height:</td><td>175 cm or 5′8″</td></tr><tr><td>Weight:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Hair style:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Waist size:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Hips:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Feet size:</td><td>No Data</td></tr><tr><td>Have tattoo:</td><td>No Data</td></tr></table><p>Raúl Castro, the Cuban politician, stands at 1.75 m (5’ 7"). His body measurements have been an essential part of his public life in many ways.</p><p>As a leader in Cuba and beyond, a slim figure gives the impression that he is looking after himself and takes care of his own health – an important factor for his job. Moreover, it enables him to project confidence and vitality when engaging with people as well as appearing strong on camera.</p><p>Being physically agile helps him move around various regions quickly while also allowing him to look sharp when wearing formal attire during occasions like international meetings or state visits. All these factors make Castro's weight, height and overall body measurements vital to his political career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikpa25tsSNp5ytZ5WjfKSxy56Zq6GknrK0e9GarKVlk5bAtb7OaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html&text=Ral%20Castro%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Weight%20and%20Height%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Family%2c%20and%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html&title=Ral%20Castro%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Weight%20and%20Height%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Family%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html&title=Ral%20Castro%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Weight%20and%20Height%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Family%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html&title=Ral%20Castro%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Weight%20and%20Height%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Family%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fra%25C3%25BAl-castro-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html&description=Ral%20Castro%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Weight%20and%20Height%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Family%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rebecca-gayheart-you-need-to-be-able-to-take-care-of-yourself-never-depend-on-a-man.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebecca Gayheart: You need to be able to take care of yourself &amp;amp; never depend on a man">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ncuti-gatwa-legs-does-he-have-tattoos-on-them.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ncuti Gatwa Legs: Does He Have Tattoos On Them?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
