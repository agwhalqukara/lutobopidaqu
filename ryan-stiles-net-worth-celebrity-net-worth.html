Elsewhere, Stiles has made guest appearances on such shows as "Murphy Brown," "American Housewife," and "Young Sheldon."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Ryan Stiles was born on April 22, 1959 in Seattle, Washington as the youngest of five children of Canadian parents Irene and Sonny. When he was 10, he moved with his family to Vancouver, British Columbia, where his father worked as a supervisor at a fish processing plant. Stiles was educated at R.C. Palmer Junior Secondary School and Richmond Senior Secondary. Despite being a good student, he got so carried away with the freedom of his senior year that he dropped out just months before graduating.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Stiles began his comedy career doing stand-up at clubs around the Vancouver area. He also assisted Rich Elwood in launching the Punchlines Comedy Club. Stiles expanded his repertoire by becoming the head writer of the CTV program "The Don Harron Show" and the host of CBC's "Comedy College." He continued performing comedy, doing improv with the Vancouver Theatresports League and Punchlines' No Name Player. Stiles eventually joined the improv group Second City, which he performed with in Toronto and later Los Angeles.</p><h2 id=whose-line-it-anyway><strong>Whose Line is it Anyway?</strong></h2><p>In 1989, Stiles drew the attention of the producers of "Whose Line is it Anyway?," a British improv comedy television show that aired on Channel 4.

Stiles was a regular on the program until its end in early 1999, and gained a devoted following in the United Kingdom for his work. He went on to become a regular performer on the US adaptation of "Whose Line is it Anyway?," which originally ran from 1998 to 2007. On the American version, Stiles was joined by <a href=# title="Colin Mochrie Net Worth">Colin Mochrie</a> and <a href=# title="Wayne Brady Net Worth">Wayne Brady</a>, with the host being Drew Carey.
