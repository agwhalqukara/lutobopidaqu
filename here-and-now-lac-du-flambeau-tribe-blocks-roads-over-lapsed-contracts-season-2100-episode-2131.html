MARRY FELZKOWSKI.</p><p>HER DISTRICT ALSO INCLUDES LAC DU FLAMBEAU WHERE ACCESS TO HOMES OVER TRIBAL LAND HAS BEEN BLOCKED OVER AN EASEMENT DISPUTE.</p><p>>> IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE LAC DU FLAMBEAU BLOCKED FOUR ACCESS ROADS THROUGH TRIBAL LANDS AND RESIDENTS SAY THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THE CHANGE WILL COME ANY TIME SOON.</p><p>>> UNLESS ALL THE PARTIES ARE REALLY WILLING TO SIT DOWN IN PERSON, I'M CONCERNED THIS COULD DRAG ON FOR A WHILE.</p><p>>> THE DISPUTE THAT BLOCKED THE ROADS HAS TAKEN COURSE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.</p><p>STARTING IN 2013, AGREEMENTS FOR PASSAGE ON THE ROADS LAPSED BETWEEN THE TRIBE AND TITLE COMPANIES THAT ENSURE MOST THE HOUSES IN THE AREA.</p><p>SINCE THEN NO NEW AGREEMENT HAS BEEN IN PLACE.</p><p>THE ROADS IN QUESTION CUT THROUGH TRIBAL LANDS, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE TRIBE, MEANS NON-TRIBAL HOMEOWNERS HAVE BEEN TRESPASSING.</p><p>HE SAID HE AND HIS NEIGHBORS WERE GIVEN ABOUT TWO WEEKS' NOTICE BEFORE THE BARRIERS CAME UP.</p><p>IN A STATEMENT RELEASED JANUARY 31, THE LAC DU FLAMBEAU TRIBAL PRESIDENT JOHN JOHNSON SENIOR SAID QUOTE THE LAND OF LAC DU FLAMBEAU AND TITLE COMPANIES HAVE NOT ALWAYS ACTED IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE THE IRISH.</p><p>THE OF -- ISSUE.</p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE BARRIERS, FIRST AMERICAN, ONE OF THE TITLE COMPANIES INVOLVED, TOLD PBS WISCONSIN, QUOTE, FIRST AMERICAN TITLE HAS MADE A GOOD FAITH OFFER ON BEHALF OF OUR INSURED HOME OWNERS BASED ON RIGHT OF WAY EASEMENTS.</p><p>THOUGH FIRST AMERICAN SAID THEY MADE AN OFFER, THE BARRIERS HAVE REMAINED IN PLACE.</p><p>BECAUSE OF THESE ROADS BEING BLOCKED, ABOUT 55 HOUSEHOLD NOW STUCK IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE CARS COULD LEAVE BUT NOT BE ALLOWED BACK IN.</p><p>>> THE THING WE'VE TRIED TO SAY IS THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY ARE PAYING THE PRICE ARE THE HOME OWNERS.</p><p>>> TO GET GROCERIES AND SUPPLIES, THEY WALK ACROSS THE LAKE TO THEIR CAR, WHICH IS PARKED AT A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE LOCATED ON A PUBLIC ROAD.</p><p>>> IF WE NEED TO GET GROCERIES, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR KIDS ARE ALL GROWN BUT WE HAVE THEIR PLASTIC SLEDS AND WALK ACROSS THE LAKE AND GO TO OUR NEIGHBORS AND GET THE JEEP AND ONLY GET AS MUCH AS STUFF AS WE CAN FIT ON THE SLEDS BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO MAKE IT BACK.</p><p>>> HE SAID THE TRUCK ACROSS THE LAKE ISN'T TOO BAD FOR HIS FAMILY BUT FOR OTHERS IN HIS COMMUNITY THE TRIP ISN'T POSSIBLE.</p><p>>> WE HAVE A PERSON AND IS THE HAD A HIGH SCHOOLER THAT IS A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD AND SHE AND HER CHILD HAD TO LEAVE AND MOVE BACK TO IOWA TO SOME FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY -- THERE WAS NO WAY TO HANDLE THIS OTHERWISE.</p><p>>> WHILE THE ROADS ARE BLOCKED, THE SHERIFF SAID HE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE LAC DU FLAMBEAU TRIBAL POLICE WHO SAY THEY HAVE DIRECTED TWICE DAILY WELLNESS CHECKS.</p><p>POLICE SAY THEY HAVE DELIVERED MEDICATION TO AT LEAST TWO RESIDENTS AND OFFERED FOOD BOX DELIVERIES.</p><p>HOWEVER, HE SAID THE WELLNESS CHECKS ARE FAR LESS FREQUENT THAN THE TRIBE CLAIMS.</p><p>>> THEY'VE BEEN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TWICE IN THAT TIME.</p><p>I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE MAYBE ONLY HAD A CHECK-IN ONE TIME.</p><p>>> WHILE RESIDENTS WAIT FOR A SOLUTION TO GRANT THEM ACCESS TO THE ROADS AGAIN, GOVERNOR EVERS MET WITH TRIBAL LEADERS MONDAY AND SAID THE MEETING WAS PRODUCTIVE.</p><p>IN A STATEMENT THE GOVERNOR SAID, QUOTE, AS THIS IS AN ONGOING PRIVATE DISPUTE, MY PRIORITY AS GOVERNOR IS ENCOURAGING EVERYONE IN THE AREA TO ENGAGE AMICABLY AND PEACEFULLY WHILE WORKING TO BRING ALL PARTIES TO THE TABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE QUICKLY.</p><p>THE TRIBE PUT OUT A STATEMENT HOPING BE RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THE TOWN MET TUESDAY TO CONSIDER POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION.</p><p>ONE POSSIBLE SHORT-TERM SOLUTION REQUESTED BY BOTH THE TOWN AND FIRST AMERICAN WOULD BE TO NEGOTIATE NEW EASE MANIES AND LIFT THE BARRIERS WHILE NEGOTIATES.</p><p>HOWEVER, NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN.</p><p>HE SAID NOBODY IS SHARE WHEN THE BARRICADING WILL BE LIFTED.</p><p>>> WE NEED THESE PEOPLE TO ALL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TO GET THIS FIGURED OUT, GET THE ROADS UNBLOCKED AND GET THE EASEMENTS IN PLACE, MAKE SURE THE TRIBE IS COMPENSATED FAIRLY FOR THEIR EASEMENTS AND WE CAN ALL GET BACK TO LIVES.</p><p>>> FOR "HERE & NOW", I'M NATHAN</p><p class=postsid
