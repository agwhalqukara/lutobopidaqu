Created by Alexi Hawley, the series is based on the true story of William Norcross, a real officer with the LAPD who moved to Los Angeles in 2015 and also joined the department in his mid-40s. The show premiered in October 2018 and was renewed for a sixth season on ABC, which will now air in 2024 due to the now-resolved Hollywood strikes.</p><p>Who is The Rookie cast dating?

The actor was last romantically linked to actress and model Krista Allen. He was also briefly engaged to Spanish actress Christina Ocha and actress Mikaela Hoover around 2013 – 2014. However, Fillion’s longest and most serious relationship was said to have been with Entourage actress Perrey Reeves from 2005 and 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked what his exes would say about him if they were all together in one room, he told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Women’s Health</a> in September 2010, “Oh, boy.
